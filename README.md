# Project 2 - *SimpleTweet*

**SimpleTweet** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
- [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  - [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  - [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [x] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
- [ ] Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel "twitter branded"
- [ ] Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser
- [ ] User can tap a tweet to display a "detailed" view of that tweet
- [ ] User can see embedded image media within the tweet detail view
- [ ] User can watch embedded video within the tweet
- [ ] User can open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets

At one point during development Android Studio stopped being able to detect the emulator. This was resolved by creating a new one with the same configurations.
